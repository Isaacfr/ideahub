Dog Generator
This is a dog generator utilizing the <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/">Dog CEO API</a>. It generates different information based on the dog breed selected by the user.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript
I based this project around utilizing an API. I wanted to use all my skills to create a project that was fun, responsive and stylish.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that JavaScript does not shuffle data properly. I had to learn about the Fisher-Yates Shuffle, an algorithm that properly shuffles elements, in this case, of an array. I also utilized how to properly use an API and that <a href="postman.co">Postman.co</a> is very useful in testing what an API produces. I did use a template for this project, but I modified the CSS and JS in order to have a project that looks clean. The API uses some pictures that do not show the dog correctly, so I had to modify the code in order to create a more appealing result. I plan to utilize more APIs for future projects and I cannot wait to get them started.
